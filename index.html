<h1><strong>Motivation</strong></h1>
<hr />
<p>This case study is motivated by this <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11920-012-0331-6.pdf">article</a>:</p>
<div id="section-section-8" class="section level4 reference_block">
<h4 class="reference_block"></h4>
<p>Flannery, D. J., Modzeleski, W. &amp; Kretschmar, J. M. Violence and School Shootings. Curr Psychiatry Rep 15, 331 (2013). DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-012-0331-6">10.1007/s11920-012-0331-6</a></p>

<h4></h4>
<p>The article explores characteristics of school shootings and violence in schools and discusses why these events may occur, as well as their impact on the communities in which they occur.</p>
<p>The article also states that the shooters are most commonly white males, but that many previous studies of shooter characteristics could not identify any particular “profile” of shooters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To date, studies of school shootings have concluded that no consistent and reliable profile of school shooters exist…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However previous studies note some commonalities such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…most shooters were depressed, had experienced some significant loss, felt persecuted or bullied by others, and had prior difficulty coping or had previously tried suicide.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore in our dashboard we will examine how often a shooter was male or attempted or committed suicide during an event.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"School shootings are not all the same and may require different approaches to prevention and treatment, especially with respect to identifying risk factors at the individual, school or community levels, and particularly with regard to examining the role that mental health issues may play to increase risk for perpetration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The field <strong>needs to know more</strong> about shooting incidents that are averted, those that result in injury but not death and about the characteristics of the more common occurrence of single homicide school shootings."</p>

<p>Given this need for more research to better understand why these events occur and how they could be averted, in this case study we will demonstrate how to create a resource for others to more easily and interactively access data about school shootings. To do so we will create what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business)">dashboard</a>, which is a website that displays a report for a database. Dashboards summarize the data in a database and typically allow for users to interact with the data in some way.</p>
<p><a href="https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/shiny-crandash/#dashboardl">Here</a> you can see an example of a dashboard created in R about downloads of packages on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.</p>
<p>On the website the tabs and plots are interactive. The above dashboard allows for users to get to know the data in a simple and quick way.</p>
<p>The data about package downloads is succinctly summarized in an impactful manner.</p>
<p><a href="https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/shiny-crandash/#dashboardl" target="_blank"><img src="www/img/dashboard.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></a></p>
<p>We can quickly get a sense that the <code>magrittr</code> package is among the top most widely downloaded packages on CRAN.</p>

<h1><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></h1>
<hr />
<p>In this case study, we will demonstrate how to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business)">dashboard</a>, which is a website that displays a report about a database. In doing so, we will focus on packages and functions from the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank"><code>tidyverse</code></a> for the data wrangling and visualization sections. The tidyverse is a library of packages created by RStudio. While some students may be familiar with previous R programming packages, these packages make data science in R more human-readable and intuitive.</p>
<p><img src="https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/logo.png" width="20%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The skills, methods, and concepts that students will be familiar with by the end of this case study are:</p>
<p><u><strong>Data Science Learning Objectives:</strong></u></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Importing text from a Google Sheets document (<code>googlesheets4</code>)<br />
</li>
<li>Converting date formats (<code>lubridate</code>)<br />
</li>
<li>Geocoding data (<code>ggmap</code>) and creating a jitter for geocoded data on a map (<code>SF</code>)</li>
<li>How to reshape data by pivoting between “long” and “wide” formats and drop rows with <code>NA</code> values (<code>tidyr</code>)<br />
</li>
<li>How to create data visualizations with <code>ggplot2</code></li>
<li>An introduction to the basics of R Markdown</li>
<li>How to create an interactive table (<code>DT</code>)<br />
</li>
<li>How to create a map (<code>leaflet</code>)<br />
</li>
<li>How to create an interactive dashboard with <code>flexdashboard</code> and <code>shiny</code></li>
</ol>
<p><u><strong>Statistical Learning Objectives:</strong></u></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Calculating percentages for data with missing values<br />
</li>
<li>Creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_statistics">summary statistics</a></li>

<h1><strong>Context</strong></h1>
<hr />
<p>School shootings get a lot of attention in the the media, but it would be helpful to see all the data on them at once to better understand them. A dashboard can help with this, so that people get a boarder understanding of the issue rather than hearing about singular specific incidences from the media.</p>
<p>In addition to injuries and deaths, shooting events can also have broad and lasting impacts for those who witness but are not directly involved.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://injury.research.chop.edu/violence-prevention-initiative/types-violence-involving-youth/school-shootings">Center for Injury Research and Prevention at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common shootings on school grounds rarely involve large numbers of victims, but even a shooting of just one student at school has ramifications far beyond those directly involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Students and staff that witness school shootings are likely to suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_stress">traumatic stress</a> symptoms, become anxious or depressed and have general concerns about their safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While many witnesses will have temporary symptoms, others will be symptomatic for a much longer period of time and even develop chronic psychiatric disorders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even short-term impairments can cause severe distress and have profound effects on academic achievement and the social and emotional growth of impacted students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, school shootings can have vast and lasting impacts because many students can witness a single event.</p>
<p>Another recently published <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/19-036.pdf">article</a> indicates that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over <strong>240,000</strong> American students experienced a school shooting in the last two decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="www/img/exposed.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<div id="section-source-1" class="section level5">
<h5><a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/19-036.pdf">[source]</a></h5>
<p>This study followed students who experienced a school shooting the United States between 2008 and 2013 and assessed their mental well-being. They found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fatal school shootings have large and persistent impacts on the mental health of local youth. In the two years following a fatal school shooting, the monthly number of antidepressant prescriptions written to individuals under age 20 is 21.3 percent higher in the shooting-exposed relative to the reference areas.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-section-13" class="section level4">
<h4></h4>
<p>Thus, it is useful to better understand the characteristics of these shootings. Having better data on what they look like nationwide can help with identifying associations of shootings with key characteristics. Better descriptive information such as this may then lead to more knowledge about factors that predict school shootings, which could help develop preventive interventions. This way, we might not only prevent the direct involvement of students in future events, but also to prevent students and staff from witnessing these events.</p>

<div id="section-limitations" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Limitations</strong></h1>
<hr />
<p>There are some important considerations regarding this data analysis to keep in mind:</p>
<p>This dashboard only uses one source of data. There may be school shooting events that are not listed in this data or errors in this data.</p>
<p>According to the database website itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This database was developed from open-source information and may include reporting errors.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, according to this <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-012-0331-6">article</a>, schools in 2013, schools were not required to report school shootings unless they resulted in a suicide or homicide. Therefore there may be more events that result in only injury or no injuries or death that may not be included.</p>
<p>There are indeed events in the dataset that include zero deaths and zero injuries, but it is very likely that many of these events are not listed.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-what-are-the-data" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>What are the data?</strong></h1>

<p>This database includes information about school shooting events for students in grades K-12 in the United States dating back to 1970. The database has additional information not shown on our dashboard including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location of the event at the school<br />

<h1><strong>Data Import</strong></h1>
<hr />
<p>Previously, the website for this data was located at “<a href="https://www.chds.us/ssdb/dataset/" class="uri">https://www.chds.us/ssdb/dataset/</a>” (which is no longer an active link), which displayed an active Google Sheets document and a link to download a csv file of the data. At the time that we created this case study (June of 2020) we downloaded the data from this website.</p>
<p>Now the data can be found at this <a href="https://www.chds.us/ssdb/about/">link</a> and a file of the raw data can be downloaded by clicking the “DOWNLOAD RAW DATA” button. This file was previously a <code>.csv</code> file, but it is now an <code>.xlsx</code> file.</p>
<p>To account for changes with this website, we have made the previous <code>.csv</code> file available for you to download using the <code>OCSdata</code> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb4-1"><a href="#section-cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># library(OCSdata)</span></span>

<p>If you have trouble using the package, you may also download this <code>.csv</code> file <a href="https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-school-shootings-dashboard/blob/master/data/raw/K-12_SSDB_(Public)-K-12_SSDB_(Public)_Linked.csv">here</a>.</p>
<p>In our case, we downloaded this data and put it within a “raw” subdirectory of a “data” directory for our project. If you use an RStudio project, then you can use the <code>here()</code> function from the <code>here</code> package to make the path for importing this data simpler. The <code>here</code> package automatically starts looking for files based on where you have a <code>.Rproj</code> file which is created when you start a new RStudio project. We can specify that we want to look for the "K-12_SSDB_(Public)-K-12_SSDB_(Public)_Linked.csv" file within the “raw” directory within the “data” directory within a directory where our <code>.Rproj</code> file is located by separating the names of these directories using commas and listing “data” first.</p>

<p>We can import the raw <code>.csv</code> file using the <code>read_csv()</code> function from the <code>readr</code> package.

By doing this, we can check for errors before reading in the entire file. Note that you would need to modify the <code>file</code> argument if you set your data files up differently.</p>

<p>We can also use the utils <code>str()</code> function, which is short for “structure” to see more details about the internal structure of the data. Therefore, the <code>str()</code> function will give us more information about the actual values for each column within the data, not just the columns themselves. Typically we would be able to see some of the values with <code>glimpse()</code> function as well, but some of the columns have very long names, thus obscuring the first few values in the output.</p>

<p>We can see from this that many of the variables have Yes or No values, while others have relatively long descriptions. You may also notice that the <code>State</code> values are state abbreviations, not full state names. This is something that we will add to the data later.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if we wanted to make a dashboard that continually updated as data got updated, we could do the following to import the data directly from a live Google Sheets document as previously this was available for this data.</p>
<p>To do so we would use the <code>read_sheet()</code> function from the <code>googlesheets4</code> package. Typically authentication is required, (meaning that you would need to sign in with your Google account using a username and or password), but since this was a public sheet we did not need to worry about authentication. To avoid being asked about this we used the <code>gs4_deauth()</code> function which puts the package into a de-authorized state that will not ask for users to sign in.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb12"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb12-1"><a href="#section-cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>googlesheets4<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">gs4_deauth</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Great, now we would need to get the shared link from the document. We could previously do so by clicking on the link to the actually Google Sheets document like so:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/gettodoc.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Then we can click on the “share” button to get access to the link:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/gettoshare.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Finally we can click on “copy link” button to copy the link:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/getlink.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Once you copy a link like this, you can use the <code>read_sheet()</code> function to import the data by simply pasting the link in quotes, like so:</p>

<p>Now we will combine this with our data using the <code>left_join()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package. There are several ways to join data using the <code>dplyr</code> package.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html">here</a> for more details about joining data.</p>
<p>We probably have data for all fifty states, but there may not have been school shootings in all 50 states in this dataset, therefore we don’t want to use the <code>full_join()</code> function.</p>
<p>We also don’t want the <code>inner_join()</code> function because <code>DC</code> does not have a state name. According to Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a> provides for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_district">federal district</a> under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_home_rule">exclusive jurisdiction</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress">Congress</a>; the district is therefore not a part of any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state">U.S. state</a> (nor is it one itself)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus we will use the <code>left_join(x,y)</code> function where <code>x</code> in this case will be the <code>shooting_data</code> (as it is introduced to this code first through the <code>%&lt;&gt;%</code> compound assignment pipe operator) and <code>y</code> is the <code>state_df</code>. Thus, we add the <code>state_df</code> values where they match to the <code>shooting_data</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>%&lt;&gt;%</code> compound operator allows us to use the an input and reassign it at the end after all the subsequent steps have been performed. We can therefore use <code>data_input %&lt;&gt;%</code> instead of <code>data_input &lt;- data_input %&gt;%</code>. We will demonstrate this in the code below.</p>

<p>In contrast, we can just use the <code>%&gt;%</code> pipe operator to select a set of columns and peek at the first four rows of the new data frame.</p>

<p><em>Note that in this case study, we will mostly be visualizing the data. However, for more intensive analysis, it would be better to make names more tidy, such as using lowercase and no spaces etc.</em></p>
<p>These are the variables that have <code>Y/N</code> in the name or the <code>Targeted Specific Victim(s)</code>, <code>Random Victims</code>, <code>Pre-planned school attack</code> variables.</p>
<p>We can make these consistently <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> by using the <code>case_when()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package. This function allows us to specify new values for existing values.</p>

If you are familiar with the <code>recode()</code> function from <code>dplyr</code>, click here for an explanation of why <code>case_when()</code> is better in this case.
</summary>
<p>The benefit of the <code>case_when()</code> function, is that changing the values to <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> also results in the class type of the variable changing to type logical (which is interpreted as a binary variable with <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> values) otherwise, with <code>recode()</code> the variables would remain as class type character.</p>

Click here for an explanation about data types in R.
</summary>
<p>There are several classes of data in R programming. Character is one of these classes. A character string is an individual data value made up of characters. This can be a paragraph, like the legend for the table, or it can be a single letter or number like the letter <code>"a"</code> or the number <code>"3"</code>. If data are of class character, than the numeric values will not be processed like a numeric value in a mathematical sense.</p>
<p>If you want your numeric values to be interpreted that way, they need to be converted to a numeric class. The options typically used are integer (which has no decimal place) and double precision (which has a decimal place).</p>
<p>Similarly if your data is of class character and are values of <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> they will be interpreted as two different strings.</p>
<p>However, <strong>logical data</strong> is interpreted slightly differently where a <code>FALSE</code> value indicates the absence of something, while a <code>TRUE</code> indicates the presence of something.</p>

Click here for more details about the differences between the <code>recode()</code> and <code>case_when()</code> functions.
</summary>
<p>Note that with <code>recode()</code> there is the option that other values be recoded to <code>NA</code> although this is not the default, however with <code>case_when()</code> other values not explicitly assigned in the <code>case_when()</code> statement will be assigned to <code>NA</code>. Further more only values can be used on the left side when using <code>recode()</code> whereas <code>case_when()</code> accepts expressions.</p>

<p>OK let’s start by looking at the columns of interest by using the <code>select()</code> function and asking for any patterns that match the character string “Y/N” or “Specific” or “Random” or “Pre-planned”.</p>
<p>Formally, we can search for these using the <code>|</code> symbol, which is interpreted as an or, thus any variables that has a name that matches any of these patterns will be changed.</p>

<p>In the above code chunk, we did this for one of the columns, but now let’s do for all the columns that matched our string “Y/N|Specific|Random|Pre-planned” as above.</p>
<p>To do this, we will use the <code>across()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package and the <code>matches()</code> function from the <code>tidyselect</code> package to allow us to apply this to all of the variables that have a pattern that that matches any of those of the variables we want to change.</p>
<p>The <code>across()</code> function then applies the <code>case_when()</code> function to all of these variables. Notice that the <code>~</code> symbol is necessary before the function that is applied using <code>across()</code>.</p>

<div id="section-geocoding-with-the-ggmap-package" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Geocoding with the <code>ggmap</code> package</strong></h2>
<p>For the purpose of our dashboard, we are interested in creating a map.</p>
<p>To do this, we need to perform a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding">geocoding</a>. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>
<p>To perform the geocoding we need the address of each school in the data set. The data currently does not list the actual address, but does have information about the school where the event occurred.</p>
<p>Since some schools have the same name, we need the city and state data as well. So we will create a new variable in our data called <code>address</code> using the <code>mutate()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package.</p>
<p>This variable will collapse the values in the <code>School</code>, <code>City</code>, and <code>State</code> columns but with spaces in between. It is specified such that there will be space in between by the <code>sep = " "</code> argument.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: a space is typed between the quotation marks.</p>
<p>In this way, we then can use the address variable to look up the latitude and longitude for each school.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb41"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb41-1"><a href="#section-cb41-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>shooting_data <span class="sc">%&lt;&gt;%</span></span>

<p>We can take a look at just this new <code>address</code> variable using the <code>pull()</code> function from the <code>dplyr()</code> package.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb42"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb42-1"><a href="#section-cb42-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>shooting_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

[4] &quot;John F. Kennedy High School Cleveland OH&quot;    
[5] &quot;David Starr Jordan High School Long Beach CA&quot;
[6] &quot;Pine Bluff Coleman High School Pine Bluff AR&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use these addresses to find the latitude and longitude coordinates for each school where a school shooting occurred.</p>
<p>To do this, we will use the <code>geocode()</code> function from the <code>ggmap</code> package to look up these addresses on Google Maps to get the latitude and longitude values. In the <code>geocode()</code> function, we also need to specify that we want to use google as the source using the <code>source</code> argument and that we want latitude and longitude using the <code>output = c("latlon")</code> argument.</p>
<p>This step requires registering with the Google Cloud Platform to get an API key, which currently requires registering your payment information and agreeing to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/terms">Google Maps API Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>You are <strong>not required to do this yourself</strong>! We will give you the data.</p>

<p>If you were to do this process yourself, you could get an API key <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/">here</a>. Again this requires registering your payment information, but it is free to got an API key and enable the APIs, however you can be billed based on how many addresses you look up using the APIs. You need to look up thousands before getting billed.</p>
<p>Then you need to enable the maps and places APIs, by clicking on the boxes next to each:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/enable.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Then you would register like so after copying the API key: (Note this is a fake key)</p>

</details>
<hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:#333;background-color:#333;" />
<p>Once we have obtained an API key and are registered, we can geocode our data.</p>
<p>Note that this step is time intensive, as there are many addresses to look up! Therefore, we will just show how this is done and <strong>will not evaluate the code for the next few code chunks</strong>. Again we will use the <code>geocode()</code> function from the <code>ggmap</code> package to perform this step.</p>

<span id="section-cb45-5"><a href="#section-cb45-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                                 <span class="at">source =</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;google&quot;</span>)))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This results in tibble called <code>coords</code> being added to our <code>shooting_data</code> tibble. That’s right, we can have a tibble as a column or variable within a tibble. Using the <code>glimpse</code> function again, and looking at the last few variables, we can see that now the last variable listed is <code>coords</code> of class <code>&lt;tibble&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="www/img/shooting_data_coords.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>If we take a look at the first couple of values of the <code>coords</code> tibble, we see a tibble that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/coords.png" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>It would be better if each of these were their own columns in the tibble, so we will create new <code>longitude</code> and <code>latitude</code> variables again using the <code>mutate</code> function like so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb46"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb46-1"><a href="#section-cb46-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>shooting_data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> </span>
<span id="section-cb46-2"><a href="#section-cb46-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  shooting_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="section-cb46-3"><a href="#section-cb46-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">mutate</span>(<span class="at">longitude =</span> <span class="fu">pull</span>(coords,lon),</span>
<span id="section-cb46-4"><a href="#section-cb46-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>         <span class="at">latitude =</span> <span class="fu">pull</span>(coords,lat))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case we use the <code>pull()</code> function to grab the <code>lat</code> and <code>lon</code> variables within the <code>coords</code> tibble which is a variable of the <code>shooting_data</code> tibble. This can also be done using the <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pack.html"><code>unpack()</code> function</a> from the <code>tidyr</code> package.</p>
<p>We can now remove the <code>coords</code> tibble like so, using the <code>select()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb47"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb47-1"><a href="#section-cb47-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>shooting_data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> </span>
<span id="section-cb47-2"><a href="#section-cb47-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  shooting_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="section-cb47-3"><a href="#section-cb47-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  dplyr<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">select</span>(<span class="sc">-</span>coords)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now using <code>glimpse()</code> and looking at the last several variables, we can see that we no longer have a <code>coords</code> variable, but we do have two variables called <code>longitude</code> and <code>latitude</code> that are of class double as indicated by the <code>&lt;dbl&gt;</code>:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/double.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now we will save the geocoded data in the <code>wrangled</code> directory of our <code>data</code> directory using the <code>save</code> function.</p>
<p>This requires listing the R object, followed by the path for where the file should be saved and what it should be called. In this case it will be called <code>shooting_data_wrangled_pre_map.rda</code>. First let’s create a new object called <code>shooting_data_wrangled_pre_map</code> so it is clear in the future what we are working with when we load the data. We will also write this data to a csv file, which can be convenient for collaborators. To do this we will use the <code>write_csv()</code> function from the <code>readr</code> package.</p>

<h2><strong>Geometry lists with the <code>sf</code> package</strong></h2>
<p>In this section, we will use the <code>sf</code> (which stands for simple features) package to create what is called a geometry list of our latitude and longitude information for the schools where shootings occurred. As some school shootings occurred in the same location, we need to alter all of the locations a bit so that when we plot the data on a map, the spots indicating where school shootings occurred will not overlap for the same location.</p>
<p>Let’s learn how to do this.</p>

<p>Therefore, before we can proceed, we need to remove rows with <code>NA</code> values for the <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> variables. In other words, we need to remove rows of events that happened at schools with locations that were not identified by Google.</p>
<p>We can remove these rows using the <code>drop_na()</code> function from the <code>tidyr</code> package. We will use a <code>.</code> to indicate that we want to use the data that we are using as an input with our pipe, but then we will specify that we want to only drop rows were there is an <code>NA</code> value for either the <code>latitude</code> or <code>longitude</code> variables.</p>

<pre><code>[1] 1551   52</code></pre>
<p>We see that there were 5 events that occurred at schools with unidentified complete locations (missing either latitude, longitude, or both) that were removed from our dataset.</p>
<p>Next, we are ready to convert our coordinates variables (<code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code>) into a coordinate simple feature (or <code>sf</code> object) using the <code>st_as_sf()</code> function (converts foreign object to an <code>sf</code> object).</p>
<p>To do this, we need to specify what our coordinate variables are and we will also specify what <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/Coordinate_Reference_Systems">coordinate reference system</a>,(crs) we would like to use. In our case we will use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPSG_Geodetic_Parameter_Dataset">ESPG</a> reference number <a href="https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/">4326</a>, known as ESPG:4326 or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS84">World Geodetic System (WGS) version 84</a> which is one of the most commonly used CPS and used by by most global positioning systems, known as GPS. <strong>This tells R to use the values for the variables called <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> as latitude and longitude coordinates.</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1] 1556   52</code></pre>
<p>We can see that our <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> variables were used to create a single new variable called <code>geometry</code> of class <code>&lt;POINT</code> [<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>]<code>&gt;</code>, thus we have one less column.</p>
<p>In this case, this type of variable will always be shown. Even if we were to look at just the first 4 variables using indexes (like this: <code>[1:4]</code>), we will also see our last <code>sf</code> variable appended at the end.</p>
<p>So now we can see all variables related to location (which happen to be the first four variables and the <code>geometry</code> variable) by simply typing <code>[1:4]</code> next to the name of our tibble <code>shooting_data_geocoded</code>.</p>

<p>To allow our points to not overlap for events that took place in the same location, we will add a bit more range so that they do not overlap one another on our map.</p>
<p>To do this, we will transform the coordinates using the <code>st_transform()</code> function of the <code>sf</code> package into a two dimensional projection (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albers_projection#:~:text=The%20Albers%20equal%2Darea%20conic,that%20uses%20two%20standard%20parallels.&amp;text=The%20Albers%20projection%20is%20used,the%20United%20States%20Census%20Bureau.">Albers equal-area conic projection</a>) with units in meters using the <a href="https://spatialreference.org/ref/esri/102008/html/">crs 102008</a> reference from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri">Environmental Systems Research Institute (ERSI)</a> and then use the <code>st_jitter()</code> function from the <code>sf</code> package to allow a specified amount of range near the actual original GPS coordinates.</p>
<p>To learn more about geospatial coordinate systems see <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://guides.library.duke.edu/r-geospatial/CRS">here</a>.</p>
<p>So here we can see the output after transforming our data to the <a href="https://spatialreference.org/ref/esri/102008/html/">crs 102008</a> reference:</p>

<p>And now we will add a jitter to the points using the <code>st_jitter()</code> function, meaning that we will randomly move the coordinates a little bit to allow for points at the same location to not overlap on the map.</p>
<p>You can see the tidyverse explanation about when to use a jitter plot <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html">here</a>, they state that a jitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point, and is a useful way of handling overplotting caused by discreteness in smaller datasets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case we will allow for 50 meters of range using the <code>amount = 50</code> argument.</p>

<p>Notice how the <code>geometry</code> variables are different from what they were originally with this coordinate system:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/geometry.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Next, we separate the <code>geometry</code> variable into <code>longitude</code> and <code>latitude</code> variables again. We can use the <code>st_coordinates()</code> function from the <code>sf</code> package to extract the coordinates from our tibble as a matrix.</p>

<p>Now, just as we did previously we will create new variables called <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> from the <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> variables within the <code>coordinates</code> tibble that is part of our <code>shooting_data_wrangled_for_map</code> using the <code>pull()</code> function.</p>
<p>We will also convert our <code>shooting_data_wrangled_for_map</code> object which is currently a <code>sf</code> into a tibble using the <code>as_tibble()</code> function from the <code>tibble</code> package and then we will remove the <code>geometry</code> and <code>coordinates</code> variables using the <code>select()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package with a minus operator in front of the names of the variables to remove.</p>

<p>And now we can take a look at our last 3 variables using the <code>last_col()</code> function, which is a <code>select()</code> helper function <code>tidyr</code> package (See <a href="https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/select_helpers.html">here</a> for other <code>select()</code> helper functions).</p>
<p>The <code>last_col()</code> function allows us to select either the last column, or with a specified offset we can select a number of columns before the last column. Thus, 2 columns before the last column would be <code>last_col(offset = 2)</code> and then the <code>:</code> symbol is interpreted as through, thus we are selecting for the third to last column through the last column with <code>last_col(offset = 2):last_col()</code>.</p>

<p>We need the wangled data that is prepared both for the map and the data just before the last wrangling step Geometry lists with the <code>sf</code> package] to prepare for the map because we removed some events that did not have addresses that were identified by Google (had <code>NA</code> values for latitude or longitude).

<p>Then, you may download the wrangled data <code>.rda</code> files like so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb82"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb82-1"><a href="#section-cb82-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># library(OCSdata)</span></span>

<p>To load the downloaded data into your environment, you may double click on each of the <code>.rda</code> files in Rstudio or using the <code>load()</code> function.</p>
<p>If the package does not work for you, two RDA files (stands for R data) of the data can be found <a href="https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-school-shootings-dashboard/tree/master/data/wrangled">here</a> or slightly more directly <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-school-shootings-dashboard/master/data/wrangled/shooting_data_wrangled_for_map.rda">here</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-school-shootings-dashboard/master/data/wrangled/shooting_data_wrangled_pre_map.rda">here</a>. Download these files and then place them in your current working directory. We recommend using an RStudio project and the <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/here_here"><code>here</code> package</a> to navigate to your files more easily.</p>
<p>We have put these files in a directory called “wrangled” within a directory called “data” within our working directory (which has a .Rproj file).</p>

<p>Luckily, our data is already in pretty good shape, but we want to make our data more useful for our dashboard.</p>
<p>Let’s shorten the name of the data that was wrangled up to the last step for the map. We will use <code>shooting_data</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb84"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb84-1"><a href="#section-cb84-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>shooting_data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span>shooting_data_wrangled_pre_map</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We will also rename the data that is wrangled for the map to a shorter name:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb85"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb85-1"><a href="#section-cb85-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>shooting_data_for_map <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> shooting_data_wrangled_for_map</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s double check that our data is expected:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb86"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb86-1"><a href="#section-cb86-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">dim</span>(shooting_data)</span></code></pre></div>

<pre><code>[1] 1551   52</code></pre>
<p>Great, looks like we indeed have more rows in our <code>shooting_data</code> as we would expect.</p>
<p>There are several elements we would like to include in our dashboard.</p>
<p>One thing we would like is an interactive table.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-interactive-table" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Interactive Table</strong></h2>
<hr />
<p>We can do this using the <code>datatable()</code> function from the <code>DT</code> package.</p>

<p>This creates a searchable table and the order in which the data is displayed can be toggled to change for each variable.</p>

<p>Good, this looks as expected.</p>
<p>Now to make a plot of this data we will use the <code>ggplot2</code> package.</p>
<div id="section-section-33" class="section level4 click_to_expand_block">
<h4 class="click_to_expand_block"></h4>
<details>
<summary>
Click here for an introduction to <code>ggplot2</code>.
</summary>
<p>The <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org">ggplot2 package</a> is generally intuitive for beginners because it is based on a <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html">grammar of graphics</a> or the <code>gg</code> in <code>ggplot2</code>. The idea is that you can construct many sentences by learning just a few nouns, adjectives, and verbs. There are specific “words” that we will need to learn and once we do, you will be able to create (or “write”) hundreds of different plots.</p>
<p>The critical part to making graphics using <code>ggplot2</code> is the data needs to be in a <em>tidy</em> format. Given that we have just spent time putting our data in <em>tidy</em> format, we are primed to take advantage of all that <code>ggplot2</code> has to offer!</p>
<p>We will show how it is easy to pipe <em>tidy</em> data (output) as input to other functions that create plots. This all works because we are working within the <em>tidyverse</em>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the <code>ggplot()</code> function?</strong> As explained by Hadley Wickham:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a mapping from data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain statistical transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinates system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>ggplot2</code> Terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ggplot</strong> - the main function where you specify the dataset and variables to plot (this is where we define the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variable names)</li>
<li><strong>geoms</strong> - geometric objects
<ul>
<li>e.g. <code>geom_point()</code>, <code>geom_bar()</code>, <code>geom_line()</code>, <code>geom_histogram()</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>aes</strong> - aesthetics
<ul>
<li>shape, transparency, color, fill, line types</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>scales</strong> - define how your data will be plotted
<ul>
<li>continuous, discrete, log, etc</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The function <code>aes()</code> is an aesthetic mapping function inside the <code>ggplot()</code> object. We use this function to specify plot attributes (e.g. <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variable names) that will not change as we add more layers.</p>
<p>Anything that goes in the <code>ggplot()</code> object becomes a global setting. From there, we use the <code>geom</code> objects to add more layers to the base <code>ggplot()</code> object. These will define what we are interested in illustrating using the data.</p>

<hr />
<p>For more of an introduction on creating plots with <code>ggplot2</code> , see this <a href="https://opencasestudies.github.io/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/">case study</a></p>
<hr />
<p>First, we start with the <code>ggplot()</code> function from the <code>ggplot2</code> package.</p>
<p>This function requires that the aesthetics <code>aes()</code> be specified. This involves choosing what variable will be plotted on the x-axis and the y-axis.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb94"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb94-1"><a href="#section-cb94-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>shootings_per_year <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-96-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Using the <code>ggplot()</code> function alone will create an empty plot area. To make our plot not empty, we need to select one of the <code>geom_*</code> functions of the <code>ggplot2</code> package to specify what type of plot we want to create.</p>
<p>Assuming the <code>ggplot2</code> library is loaded, type <code>geom</code> into the RStudio console and you will see many options to scroll through.</p>
<p>Here, we use a <code>geom_col()</code> plot, which is a particular type of bar plot that uses the actual values to plot, rather than counts, which is the default of <code>geom_bar()</code>. We will specify with the <code>fill</code> argument, that we want our bars to be filled with the color black.</p>

<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-97-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We also modify the x-axis using the <code>scale_x_continuous()</code> function. This function allows for specification of the range or limits of the axis using the <code>limits</code> argument. We can use the base <code>seq()</code> function to create a sequence of numbers for each tick mark.</p>
<p>We can add labels to our plot using the <code>labs()</code> function from <code>ggplot2</code>. This has arguments such as <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> for the axes and <code>title</code> and <code>subtitle</code> for titles. We can use <code>NULL</code> to remove a label. For example to remove the x-axis label we can use <code>x = NULL</code></p>
<p>We will also modify the overall aesthetics of the plot using a <code>theme_*</code> function. See <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html">here</a> for a list of options.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: When using the <code>summarize()</code> function, we don’t need to use the <code>mutate()</code> function here.</p>
<p>Next, for the purposes of the dashboard, we actually want to create just one plot that shows both the number of school shootings per year and the number of deaths.</p>
<p>We can do so by combining our <code>shootings_per_year</code> and <code>deaths_per_year</code> tibbles together and making what is called a faceted plot, using the <code>facet_wrap()</code> function to create two plots next to one another.</p>
<p>To combine our data we will use the <code>full_join()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package. This maintains all values from both tibbles.</p>
<p>To do so we will be making our table “longer”, meaning that it will have fewer columns and more rows. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data">here</a> for more information about different table formats, typically referred to as wide and long or sometimes narrow.</p>
<p>We will use the <code>pivot_longer()</code> function from the <code>tidyr</code> package to change the shape of our table.</p>
<p>There are 3 main arguments in this function:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>cols</code> - which specifies what columns to collapse<br />
</li>
<li><code>names_to</code> - which specifies the name of the new column that will be created that will contain the column names of the columns you are collapsing<br />
</li>
<li><code>values_to</code> - which specifies the name of the new column that will be created that will contain the values from the columns you are collapsing</li>
</ol>
<p>To specify that we want to collapse all the columns that have year values, we can choose all those except the <code>Date_year</code> variable by using the <code>-</code> negative operator.</p>

<p>Hmmm, we see the data type of the <code>id</code> column is a character (<code>&lt;chr&gt;</code>). Let’s convert it to a factor, so that the order in which <code>Shootings</code> and <code>Deaths</code> appear is the order in which they appear first rather than by alphabetical order (which is default).</p>
<p>Using the <code>fct_inorder()</code> function from the <code>forcats</code> package, we can easily reorder the <code>id</code> variable`.</p>

<p>Now since we the new variable for the names is called <code>id</code> we will use this as the variable to create the facet like so: <code>facet_wrap(~id)</code>. We can also specify that we want both plots to have their own y-axis with the <code>scales = "free"</code> argument. This causes each to have the y-axis automatically scaled for the data in each plot. We can then use the <code>scale_y_continuous()</code> function to set both of the y-axes to be the same.</p>

<p>Next, we can modify the plot further so that it is more obvious what each plot is showing. We can update the names of the y-axis for each plot by changing the <code>strip.position</code> argument of the <code>facet_wrap()</code> function to be placed on the left rather than above. Currently it is the label in blue that says what the value of the <code>id</code> variable is for each plot. This also requires some modification of the <code>theme()</code> function to place the <code>strip.text</code> outside the plot area and to remove the background.Furthermore, we also change the text using the <code>labeller</code> argument of the <code>facet_wrap()</code> function. The <code>as_labeller()</code> function from the <code>ggplot2</code> package can change out the <code>id</code> values for other text like in the following code:</p>

<p>Good, Now this is much easier to interpret.</p>
<p>Our last step in this section is to save the style settings of this plot as theme so we can reuse it for future plots. To do this, we use the base <code>function()</code> function:</p>

<div id="section-yearly-cumulative-shootings" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Yearly Cumulative Shootings</strong></h2>
<hr />
<p>Now let’s make another plot of the cumulative deaths each year including those of the previous years. In this case we can use the <code>shootings_per_year</code> object that we previously made.</p>

<p>However, we want to add a new variable using the <code>mutate</code> function called <code>n_cum_sum</code> by using the <code>cumsum()</code> function to calculate a cumulative sum based on the yearly count.</p>

<p>Because of the skewed distribution, it is difficult to see the school shootings that had more numerous deaths, so we will add a facet that zooms in on this portion of the plot. We can do so, using the <code>facet_zoom()</code> function from the <code>ggforce</code> package.</p>

<p>It is still difficult to see. Let’s try some other options.</p>
<p>The <code>geom_freqpoly()</code> function creates a graph that makes it very easy to see that most school shootings result in zero or one death and that the maximum number of deaths in this data for a single event is in the upper twenties.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb120"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb120-1"><a href="#section-cb120-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>shooting_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

<p>This really shows that most school shooting events luckily result in no deaths, but what are the actual proportions of school shootings that end in 0 deaths, 1 death, 2 deaths, etc. One way to look at this is to calculate the percentage of events that resulted in each number of deaths. We can do this by dividing the number of events by the overall sum of events and multiplying by 100. The base <code>round()</code> function can round this value to the nearest 1 decimal place by specifying that we want 1 digit after the decimal with <code>digits = 1</code>.</p>

<p>We can see that greater than 60% of the events had no deaths. It is however, the plot is still unsatisfactory because there is such a long tail.</p>
<p>Next, we can try collapsing the events that resulted in 4 or more deaths together and create a pie chart which you are likely familiar with as well as alternative plot called a waffle plot.</p>
<p>First to collapse the percentage for the events that had 4 or more deaths, we need to do a bit of wrangling.</p>
<p>We will start with filtering the data to only these events and then we will sum each of the columns using the base R function <code>colSums()</code> with the goal of creating a new row in the <code>deaths_perc_event</code> object that will contain information about all events with 4 or more deaths. We will use the <code>&gt;=</code> greater than or equal to operator.</p>

<p>We could of used the<code>str_replace()</code> function from the <code>stringr</code> package to replace the value for the last row. This function would directly change the value of “85 deaths” to “4+deaths”, but this would not be as reproducible. Why is that?</p>

</summary>
<p>Say we used this code again after the data got updated. Then there may be more deaths in this category and therefore this value would no longer be “85 deaths”. Instead, by using <code>case_when()</code>, we can use an expression for the last value of the <code>deaths_perc_event</code> tibble and replace that, regardless of what the value is, with “4+deaths”. Recall that <code>case_when()</code> replaces all other values that are not specified with <code>NA</code>. We do not want to lose the other values for the <code>category</code> variable. So to avoid this, we assign each of the values that are not the last value or the <code>"1 deaths"</code> value to what they currently are for the <code>category</code> variable, using <code>TRUE ~ category</code> (Note that all remaining unassigned values are indicated as <code>TRUE</code>).</p>
<p>We could also actually type out the percentage of 4+death cases, but it is always more reproducible to instead use an expression that will evaluate to the value we want. This way if we were to update our data with additional school shooting events, this evaluation would also update.</p>

<p>OK, this looks as we hoped. OK, now we are ready to make plots.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the pie chart. Historically, this has become a bit controversial type of plot. However, it can be very useful when you are actually looking at percentages and the goal is to see major trends in the data, such as all the groups are roughly equal or one group is particularly larger than the rest. When this is the case and you are presenting the data to an audience that is less familiar with data science, they may expect to see a pie chart. Thus it is useful to know how to make one. However, in most other cases pie charts do a poor job at allowing us to see more subtle differences, and they are particularly confusing when we are not looking at proportions, but raw counts. In those cases it is better to use a bar chart as we have already done.</p>
<p>There is no <code>geom_*</code> function that allows you to create a pie chart directly. Instead we will create our bar plot as we have and then use the <code>coord_polar()</code> function to wrap our y axis into a circular shape.</p>

<p>This is actually a fairly easy plot to interpret. We can see that most events resulted in zero deaths and that the next largest proportion resulted in one death, while a sizable but small proportion resulted in two deaths. A very small proportion resulted in three or four or more deaths.</p>
<p>We also can create a waffle plot. This plot offers one advantage over the pie chart, in that it also allows for easier interpretation of more subtle proportion differences while also showing big picture differences in efficient manner.</p>
<p>First, we filter for only the data that we want to plot. We only want the 0,1,2,3, or 4+ categories. We can do so by using the <code>str_detect()</code> function from the <code>stringr</code> package. This allows us to find the values that match multiple patterns. The patterns are separated by the <code>|</code> or operator. Thus any value matching any of the patterns should be kept. Notice that the <code>\\</code> is necessary before the <code>+</code> so that is not interpreted as a mathematical plus sign.</p>
<p>The <code>waffle()</code> function requires that the data be in wide format. Thus we need to use <code>pivot_wider()</code> of the <code>tidyr</code> package to do so. This is very similar to the <code>pivot_longer()</code> function, however in this case we need to specify what existing column contains the names for the new columns using <code>names_from</code> and what existing column contains the values for the new columns using <code>values_from</code>.</p>

<h3>Percentages</h3>
<p>We are also interested in including statistics in our dashboard. For example, we are interested in how many shooters committed or attempted suicide.</p>
<p>We previously converted variables with <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code> answers because they were inconsistently coded as <code>yes</code>/ <code>y</code> and <code>no</code>/<code>n</code>. Furthermore, logical variables are easier to work with in terms of performing calculations because <code>TRUE</code> values are treated like a <code>1</code> while <code>FALSE</code> values are treated like a <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>We can calculate the percentage of shooters that committed or attempted suicide out of all entries that have data for this information. Thus we do not want to include <code>NA</code> values in the calculation, otherwise this might give us a distorted picture of the truth.</p>

<p>We can see that 97% of the school shootings have information about this variable.</p>
<p>It is important to check and report this percentage so that people can better understand if our percentages are reliable. If only 2% of the school shootings had this information and in all cases of the 2% the school shootings involved a suicide (or attempt), then this would lead people to believe that 100% of school shootings involve a shooter suicide (or attempt). This would clearly be misleading! In our case the majority of the school shootings included this information, so we will indeed report the percentage and we will also let people know how much of the school shooting data had this information.</p>

<h1><strong>Dashboard Basics</strong></h1>
<hr />
<p>We are now ready to build our dashboard!</p>
<p>Let’s introduce some basics about creating dashboards in R in the <code>flexdashboard</code> package.</p>
<p>Note that you can also start the case study at this point, we will let you know how to get the data that you need.</p>
<div id="section-dashboard-packages" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Dashboard packages</strong></h2>
<hr />
<p>To make our dashboard we will use three very useful packages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">flexdashboard</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Flexdashboard is a package that was created by RStudio and <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/05/17/flexdashboard-easy-interactive-dashboards-for-r/">released</a> in May of 2016. This package allows for users to more easily create dashboards using <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-flexdashboards/">here</a> for a video about flexdashboard and <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">here</a> for a more information on how to use this package.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">leaflet</a></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> is the leading open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps and is used by many websites. The <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">leaflet</a> R package allows for users to more easily integrate leaflet maps in R, to create maps like the one below. We will use this package to create a map of where school shootings have occurred in the US.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an interactive map made with <code>leaflet</code></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> (which has been implemented by many languages, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a>, etc.) is a language of a particular class of programming languages called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">lightweight markup languages (LML)</a>.</p>
<p>LMLs have relatively simple and intuitive syntax, and are therefore relatively easy to write and read and are converted by software into some type of less human-friendly language to create an output document like a PDF or an HTML file. In fact, multiple output files can be created from the same LML file!</p>
<p>In our case we are interested in rendering our Rmd document into a website. The code in our R Markdown document will be interpreted and converted ultimately into HTML code.</p>
<p>Although LMLs tend to be quite similar, here you can see some of the differences in syntax:</p>

<h2><strong>Flexdashboard</strong></h2>
<hr />
<p>There are several important features about the R Markdown language that the <code>flexdashboard</code> package leverages.</p>
<p>These features are used to specify the layout and elements of the dashboard.</p>
<p>Here are some major R Markdown features to keep in mind for <code>flexdashboard</code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The beginning of an R Markdown document is what is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> header. This is delineated by <code>---</code> three dash marks before and after the header YAML code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like so: <img src="www/img/yaml.png" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<div id="section-source-11" class="section level5">
<h5><a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/rmarkdown/">[source]</a></h5>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> is yet another language, but unlike Markdown it is a data-oriented language and is often used for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file">configuration</a> of software or to set up how a software program should work.</p>
<p>Whatever code you put in the YAML header will influence the rest of the document and essentially set up how the R Markdown document will render. In the example above, the type of output is specified.</p>
<p>Other more complicated features can be included. For example, we can specify that we are creating a dashboard with <code>flexdashboard</code> and we can specify how we want the layout of our dashboard to be displayed like so:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/yaml_dashboard.png" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-source-12" class="section level5">
<h5><a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/layouts.html">[source]</a></h5>
<p>We will describe this in more detail soon.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To add a page to a navigation bar (also called a navbar) the following syntax is used <code>=======</code>. The number of dashes does not matter. (This is a level 1 header in Markdown, just like <code>#</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>To add columns or rows the following syntax is used <code>---------</code>. By default this notation will create new columns, however if the YAML is modified to specify to create rows, than this same syntax will be used to create rows. The number of dashes does not matter. (This is a level 2 header in Markdown, just like <code>##</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Components within the dashboard are delineated by using <code>###</code> - if you are familiar with Markdown notation, this is a level 3 Markdown header.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If this includes text like so: <code>### text</code>, this adds header text to the component, however this is not required.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To include a plot or any output from R, use the following syntax: <code>"```{r}"</code> on it’s own line followed by your code, followed by <code>"```"</code>. This creates what is called a code chunk.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="www/img/code_chunk.png" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-source-13" class="section level5">
<h5><a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/rmarkdown/">[source]</a></h5>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Another component of <code>flexdashboard</code> is value boxes. These are essentially text boxes for statistics or text that you might like to feature or emphasize. To do this again the <code>###</code> syntax is used to put a text label describing what the value box contains followed by a code chunk that uses the <code>valueBox()</code> function from the <code>flexdasboard</code> package. The value to display is specified using the <code>value</code> argument, as well as optional other aspects using additional arguments, such as the color of the value box using the <code>color</code> argument like the example below:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>### ValueBoxText

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r}
valueBox(value = 10
  color = &quot;white&quot;)

&#39;&#39;&#39;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: in our examples of code we will use <code>"'''"</code> instead of <code>"```"</code>. This is only to allow for easy viewing of examples. All code chunks require <code>"```"</code>.</p>
<p>Here you can see a more thorough example which includes icons: <img src="www/img/valuebox.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-source-14" class="section level5">
<h5><a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/using.html#value_boxes">[source]</a></h5>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Instead of value boxes you can also include a slight variation called a gauge. These are created with the <code>guage()</code> function from the <code>flexdashboard</code> package. This requires numeric values for a <code>value</code>, a <code>min</code>, and a <code>max</code> argument. Optionally, a symbol can also be added with the <code>symbol</code> argument. The value argument does not have to be explicitly called though, which is also true of the <code>valueBox()</code> function.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre><code>### GuageText

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r}
flexdashboard::gauge(value = 10, 
                       min = 0, 
                       max = 100, 
                    symbol = &quot;%&quot;)

&#39;&#39;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This creates the following output: <img src="www/img/gauge_output.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Here is a more complicated example:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/gauge.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<h2><strong>Layout</strong></h2>
<hr />
<div id="section-adding-columns" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Adding Columns</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>To add multiple columns the following syntax is used <code>---------</code> for each column and nothing additional is required in the header.</p>
<p>Additional features about the columns, such as the width can be specified using brackets<code>{}</code>like in the example below. Note that the word <code>Column</code> isn’t necessary. In this example two columns are created that will be oriented next to one another and elements within the columns will be placed top to bottom.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="section-adding-rows" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Adding Rows</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>To add multiple rows - the yaml needs to state that the orientation is for rows instead of for columns (see the image below), and then the same syntax is used <code>---------</code> for each row instead of columns. In this example, two rows are created that will be oriented on top of one another and elements within the rows will be placed next to each other.</p>
<p>Again the word <code>Row</code> is not actually necessary.</p>

<div id="section-tabs" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Tabs</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>To add tabs columns/rows we can use the following:</p>
<pre><code>Column {.tabset}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, two columns are created and then two tabs are added to the second column.</p>
<p><img src="www/img/tab.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="section-shiny" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Shiny</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>Interactive elements can be added to dashboards. In our dashboard, we will use packages such as <code>DT</code> and <code>leaflet</code> that have shiny functionality. This requires that shiny is enabled in the YAML header by including <code>runtime:shiny</code> in the YAML.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a YAML that includes this:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/shiny_yml.png" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-deployment" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Deployment</strong></h2>
<hr />
<p>You have a few options to publish your dashboard:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If your dashboard is not interactive (does not use shiny) or uses certain widgets like the <code>datatable()</code> function from the <code>DT</code> package, you just need to knit your R Markdown file into an html file.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="www/img/knit.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Then you can host this on GitHub if you choose by changing the GitHub Pages settings of your repository:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/githubpages.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If your dashboard is interactive (uses shiny), you can host it on <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/" class="uri">https://www.shinyapps.io/</a> after making an account. To do this you need to install the <code>rsconnect</code> package and after you have made an account and configured it, you can use the publish button of the RStudio IDE which looks like this on the upper right corner:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="www/img/publish.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Note that this also requires authentication using tokens.</p>
<p>See this <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html">link</a> for a getting start for this process.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">

<h1><strong>Our Dashboard</strong></h1>
<hr />
<p>OK! Now that we know a bit about the basics of creating a dashboard, let’s create our own.</p>
<p>The link to the dashboard described in this section is located <a href="https://rsconnect.biostat.jhsph.edu/ocs-bp-school-shootings-dashboard/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We want to create a dashboard that has several tabs that will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://rsconnect.biostat.jhsph.edu/ocs-bp-school-shootings-dashboard/" target="_blank"><img src="www/img/dashboard_school.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></a></p>
<div id="section-getting-started" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Getting started</strong></h2>
<hr />
<p>The first thing we need to do to create our dashboard is to create a new .Rmd document like so in R Studio:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/newrmd.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-yaml-header" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>YAML header</strong></h2>
<hr />
<p>Next we need to update the YAML header to look like this:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/our_yaml.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>As you might expect, <code>title:</code> indicates the title of our dashboard.</p>
<p>The <code>output:</code> line specifies what type of output we want the .Rmd file to be rendered.</p>
<p>We need to include <code>flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:</code> as the output to create a dashboard with the <code>flexdashboard</code> package. This can be included on the same line as <code>output:</code> or on the next line with a preceding tab.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: that YAML is sensitive to spacing, thus this tab is required to get the proper output.</p>
<p>The next four lines are arguments for how the dashboard should be created.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><code>logo:</code> allows you to include a logo on top of your dashboard. With this theme this will be in the upper left corner. The logo we chose to use came from <a href="https://iconarchive.com/">here</a>, but you could theoretically use any png of appropriate size.</p></li>
<li><p><code>theme:</code> allows you to specify how the dashboard will look in general. Note that this can be used to modify the general look of any type of R Markdown output, not just dashboards created with <code>flexdashboard</code>. See <a href="https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/">here</a> for a list of options. In our case, the theme is called readable and will create documents that look like this:</p></li>

<div id="section-source-19" class="section level5">
<h5><a href="https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/">[source]</a></h5>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><code>orientation:</code> the options are <code>columns</code> or <code>rows</code> and specifies if the <code>--------</code> syntax creates rows or columns for the layout. This is not necessary if the option is <code>columns</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>source_code:</code> specifies if a URL will be included as a navigation bar item with access to the source code.</p></li>
<li><p><code>vertical_layout:</code> The options are <code>fill</code> or <code>scroll</code>. Fill causes the charts to re-size to fill the page, while the scroll option renders plots as their natural height which may or may not require scrolling the page.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are many other argument options for how the dashboard is displayed.</p>
<p>You can run the following command in the console to see more information about the arguments in the help pane of the R Studio <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>.</p>

<p>On this page we will have two columns - one which will be wider than the other. Size specifications on <code>flexdashboard</code> are unit-less; the width of any column included on a page is a function of the width set for a column against the sum of widths for all columns on that page. If we set columns sizes of 600 and 300 on a page with two columns, one column will be twice as large as the other column. We want the left column to be quite a bit larger than the right, so we will set the left as <code>70</code> and the right as <code>30</code>. Can you recall how we would make these columns?</p>

<p>Recall that <code>###</code> is used to add elements to columns and rows. Note that there is no text next to the <code>###</code> syntax that designates an element of our dashboard. In the previous examples, a header was used like so <code>### header</code>:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/tab.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>[<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/layouts.html">source</a>]</p>
<p>We do not actually want a header now, so we can simply use <code>###</code> without any text following it. Note that you can get away with not using the <code>###</code>, but some elements will not render properly.</p>
<p>Next, we add a block of text describing the dashboard to the first column and we will add an image to the second column like the following. Notice that two asterisks <code>**</code> around text makes them appear as bold and one <code>*</code> makes it appear as italic. See <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.html">this RStudio cheatsheet</a> for some basic Markdown syntax for stylizing text:</p>

**What is the purpose of this dashboard?**

This dashboard has two purposes:

1. To illustrate trends in school shooting events in the United States
2. To demonstrate how to create a dashboard using `R`

**The data**

This dashboard uses data from the open-source [K-12 Shool Shooting Database](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/dataset/) downloaded from the [Center for Homeland Defense and Security](https://www.chds.us/c/) at the at the [Naval Postgraduate School(NPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Postgraduate_School). This data was downloaded June of 2020.

&lt;style&gt;
div.green { background-color:#8FBC8F; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px; font-size: 1em;color: white;}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class = &quot;green&quot;&gt;
Riedman, David, and Desmond O’Neill. “CHDS – K-12 School Shooting Database.” Center for Homeland Defense and Security, June 2020, [www.chds.us/ssdb](www.chds.us/ssdb).
&lt;/div&gt;


  
This database includes information about school shooting events for students in grades K-12 in the United States dating back to 1970. The database has additional information not shown on our dashboard including, but not limited to: location of the event at the school, source for the shooting information, shooter characteristics, and victim characteristics. 

### 


&lt;u&gt;**Want to learn how to create a dashboard just like this?**&lt;/u&gt;

Visit the [*Tutorial*](#tutorial) page of this dashboard to first learn the basics about building a dashboard with the `flexdashboard` package.

At the end of the tutorial we provide a link to this [supplementary resource by the Open Case Studies project](https://opencasestudies.github.io/ocs-bp-school-shootings-dashboard/), which provides more detailed information about how ***this dashboard*** was created.

&lt;style&gt;

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=&quot;[Photograph by Nathan Dumlao](https://unsplash.com/photos/xPHmmVKS8lM)&quot;}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here(&quot;www&quot;, &quot;img&quot;, &quot;nathan-dumlao-xPHmmVKS8lM-unsplash.jpg&quot;))
&#39;&#39;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Note that we will use <code>"'''"</code> for to show code chunks of the actual code from the dashboard.</p>
<p>The image used in this second column is from a website called unsplash (<a href="https://unsplash.com/" class="uri">https://unsplash.com/</a>) which hosts images for free use but includes information about the photographer if you chose to credit them. A short link for this image was found by clicking on it and then clicking the share button.</p>
<p>Notice the <code>echo = FALSE</code> specification for the code chunk which causes the code to be evaluated but but not shown, while <code>fig.cap</code> adds the figure caption.</p>
<p>The image is included using the <code>include_graphics()</code> function from the <code>knitr</code> package. We need to specify where this image is located for this to work. You can do this without specifying a path if the image file is in the same directory as your <code>.Rmd</code> file that you are using to create your dashboard. However using the <code>here()</code> function from the <code>here</code> package we can organize our files a bit. This function will automatically start the path wherever we have included an RStudio project file, this can be done in RStudio like so:</p>
<p><img src="www/img/project.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>If you are new to using RStudio projects, please see this <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html">link</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Then if we create a directory or folder called <code>img</code> and place our image files in this directory, then we can specify the full path to this file on our computer, by just using <code>here::here("img", "name_of_image.png")</code>. The <code>include_graphics()</code> function works for a variety image file types.</p>
<p><img src="www/img/newdir.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Also you may have noticed the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> html code to add a blue and green background to portions of the text.</p>
<p>The text that we want altered with this particular style is delineated by the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to start and the <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> to end the style.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the first one to explain what is happening here:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
div.green { background-color:#8FBC8F; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px; font-size: 1em; color: white;}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class = &quot;green&quot;&gt;
Riedman, David, and Desmond O’Neill. “CHDS – K-12 School Shooting Database.” Center for Homeland Defense and Security, June 2020, [www.chds.us/ssdb](www.chds.us/ssdb).
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The instructions for the style are within the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/style&gt;</code> content dividers. Inside these dividers is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> code, which is what is used to stylize HTML. The <code>div.green</code> is the name of this particular style which involves a particular background color (#8FBC8F - see <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp">here</a> for more options), with a boarder radius of 5 pixel to round the edges of the background color around the text with a size 5 pixel radius. The code also states that a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding">padding</a> specification for the size of the margins of the text box around the text and it specifies that font should be of 1 <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units.en.html">em units</a> (which stands for element - thus 1 unit relative to the size of the element) and that the font should be white.</p>
<p>The <code>div.green</code> specifies that <code>green</code> is the name of this style, thus we can then use <code>&lt;div class = green&gt;</code> (called a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_Selector">CSS selector</a>) to style the text this way. This can then be used again any time we want this style like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class = &quot;green&quot;&gt;

text 

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

###

The data used in this dashboard is from the [**Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS)**](Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS)) [**K-12 Shool Shooting Database**](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/about/). 

Their methods for identifying and authenticating incidents are outlined [here](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/methods/).

According to their website: 

*&quot;The database compiles information from more than 25 different sources including peer-reviewed studies, government reports, mainstream media, non-profits, private websites, blogs, and crowd-sourced lists that have been analyzed, filtered, deconflicted, and cross-referenced. **All of the information is based on open-source information and 3rd party reporting... and may include reporting errors.**&quot;*

</code></pre>
<p>Now we will add our <code>DT_table</code> to the first column. First, we need to include the code that we previously used to create the <code>DT_table</code> in our dashboard <code>.Rmd</code> file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="section-cb192"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="section-cb192-1"><a href="#section-cb192-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>DT_table <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> shooting_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="section-cb192-2"><a href="#section-cb192-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  dplyr<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">select</span>(Date,</span>

<span id="section-cb192-5"><a href="#section-cb192-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                State,</span>
<span id="section-cb192-6"><a href="#section-cb192-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                <span class="st">`</span><span class="at">Killed (includes shooter)</span><span class="st">`</span>,</span>
<span id="section-cb192-7"><a href="#section-cb192-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                <span class="st">`</span><span class="at">Narrative (Detailed Summary/ Background)</span><span class="st">`</span>) <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="section-cb192-8"><a href="#section-cb192-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">rename</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Deaths&quot;</span> <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="st">`</span><span class="at">Killed (includes shooter)</span><span class="st">`</span>) <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="section-cb192-9"><a href="#section-cb192-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">rename</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Narrative&quot;</span> <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="st">`</span><span class="at">Narrative (Detailed Summary/ Background)</span><span class="st">`</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We then include some code to render this interactive table in our dashboard. Since we have <code>shiny</code> enabled in our YAML header, we can use the <code>renderDataTable()</code> of the <code>DT</code> package to produce the output we desire.</p>
<p>We also want to use the <code>options</code> argument to specify how the data is rendered. The <code>scroller = TRUE</code> argument adds a scroll bar to the table, the <code>scrollY</code> argument specifies that the scroll bar should be for they Y axis direction (up and down) of the table and specifies how large the scroller should be, the <code>pageLength</code> argument specifies how many rows should be displayed simultaneously within the table, and the <code>autoWidth = TRUE</code> argument specifies that the table should fit the space of the column or page it is within.</p>
<p>We will also add a caption with a link to the original data using the <code>tags()</code> and <code>withTags()</code> functions of the <code>htmltools</code> package. Different options for types of tags can be selected using the <code>$</code>.</p>
<p><img src="www/img/tags.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<p>We will also add another image to the column on the right, overall the code looks like this:</p>

&#39;&#39;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>In the second column, we will include what are called value boxes to contain statistics that will remain static as the user moves through the tabs of the first column.</p>
<pre><code>Column {data-width=30}
------------------------------------- </code></pre>
<p>We want to display some important statistics, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total number of people wounded in a school shooting<br />
</li>
<li>Total number of deaths from a school shooting<br />
</li>
<li>Median number of shots fired<br />
</li>
<li>Percentage of school shootings where the shooter was the only victim<br />
</li>
<li>Percentage of school shootings where a single handgun was used<br />
</li>
<li>Percentage of school shootings where the shooter was male</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a value box we will use the <code>valueBox()</code> function from the <code>flexdashboard</code> package. The text for the the value box is specified by the text following the <code>###</code> syntax.</p>
<p>There are a few arguments to be aware of for this function:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>value</code> - this is the value to be displayed in the box - this usually a number, but might be text</li>
<li><code>caption</code> - if desired, you can add text to be displayed under the value but keep in mind that you will also include text with the <code>###</code> syntax</li>
<li><code>icon</code> - if you would like to add an icon you can specify it like so: <code>icon = fa-flag</code></li>
<li><code>color</code> - this changes the color of the box</li>
<li><code>href</code> - if you would like to add a URL link you can do so with this argument</li>
</ol>
<p>We can create a value box for the total number of people wounded as follows, where we use the base <code>sum()</code> function to calculate the sum of all the values for the <code>Wounded</code> variable which was extracted using the <code>pull()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package. We need to remove <code>NA</code> values to be able to calculate the sum and we can do this using the <code>na.rm = TRUE</code> argument.</p>
<pre><code>Column {data-width=300}
------------------------------------- 


### **Total Wounded**
    
&#39;&#39;&#39;{r}
valueBox(value = sum(pull(shooting_data, Wounded), na.rm = TRUE),
         color = &quot;white&quot;)
&#39;&#39;&#39;
    
### **Total Deaths**

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r}
valueBox(value = sum(pull(
  shooting_data,`Killed (includes shooter)`), na.rm = TRUE),
         color = &quot;white&quot;)
&#39;&#39;&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>To calculate the percentage of school shootings where the shooter committed or attempted suicide, we will use our calculation which was explained in the [Data Analysis and Visualization] section. The <code>paste0</code> function is used to add the percentage symbol.</p>
<pre><code>
### **Shooter committed or attempted suicide**

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r}

suicide &lt;- (sum(pull(shooting_data,`Suicide (or attempted suicide) by Shooter (Y/N)`), na.rm = TRUE) /
            sum(pull(shooting_data, `Suicide (or attempted suicide) by Shooter (Y/N)`)&gt;=0, na.rm = TRUE))*100
suicide &lt;- round(suicide, 1)

reporting_suic &lt;- (sum(pull(shooting_data, `Suicide (or attempted suicide) by Shooter (Y/N)`)&gt;=0, na.rm = TRUE)/
              length(pull(shooting_data, `Suicide (or attempted suicide) by Shooter (Y/N)`)))*100
reporting_suic &lt;- round(reporting_suic, 1)

valueBox(value = paste0(suicide,&quot;%&quot;), 
         color = &quot;white&quot;)
&#39;&#39;&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>For the value box of the percentage of school shootings where a single handgun was used was calculated by using the <code>case_when()</code> function to specify all cases where the <code>Firearm Type</code> variable was equal to <code>"Handgun"</code> as <code>TRUE</code> and all others as <code>FALSE</code>. This allows us to use the base <code>sum()</code> function as <code>TRUE</code> values will be counted as a value of <code>1</code> and <code>FALSE</code> values will be counted as a value of <code>0</code>. This sum was then divided by the total number of school shooting events by getting the length of the <code>Firearm Type</code> variable using the base <code>length()</code> function. The next value box about the gender of the shooter was calculated in a similar manner.</p>
<pre><code>    
### **Use of a Single Handgun**

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r}

handgun &lt;-paste(as.character(round(100 *(sum(case_when(
      pull(shooting_data,`Firearm Type`) == &quot;Handgun&quot; ~ TRUE,

    /
      sum(pull(shooting_data, `Firearm Type`)&gt;=0, na.rm = TRUE)),
    1)), &quot;%&quot;)

reporting_gun &lt;- (sum(pull(shooting_data, `Firearm Type`)&gt;=0, na.rm = TRUE)/
              length(pull(shooting_data, `Firearm Type`)))*100
reporting_gun &lt;- round(reporting_gun, 1)


valueBox(value = handgun,
  color = &quot;white&quot;)

&#39;&#39;&#39;

### **Shooter Was Male**
&#39;&#39;&#39;{r}


gender &lt;- paste(as.character(round(100 * (sum(
    case_when(pull(shooting_data,`Shooter Gender`) == &quot;Male&quot; ~ TRUE,
                                                        TRUE ~ FALSE),
                                      na.rm = TRUE)
    /
      sum(pull(shooting_data, `Shooter Gender`)&gt;=0, na.rm = TRUE)),
    1)), &quot;%&quot;)

reporting_male &lt;- (sum(pull(shooting_data, `Shooter Gender`)&gt;=0, na.rm = TRUE)/
              length(pull(shooting_data, `Shooter Gender`)))*100
reporting_male &lt;- round(reporting_male, 1)


valueBox(value = paste(gender),
  color = &quot;white&quot;)
&#39;&#39;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Additional text about the reporting rate for these statistics was added using the <code>###</code> syntax. Additionally inline code is evaluated using the notation <code>"</code>r <code>"</code> Again notice that <code>"'"</code> was used instead of <code>"</code>"` just for illustrative purposes to allow this R Markdown document to render the code from the dashboard file.</p>
<pre><code>
###

reporting rate of shooter suicide = &#39;r reporting_suic&#39;%,  
reporting rate of gun type = &#39;r reporting_gun&#39;%,  
reporting rate of shooter gender = &#39;r reporting_male&#39;%

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the other value Boxes are not included in this image. You can see that the <code>renderPlot()</code> function is used for plots and the <code>renderValueBox()</code> function is used for value boxes.</p>

<div id="section-details-3" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Details</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>On this page we want the user to be able to select data for a specific state and render plots and get statistics just for the selected state. To do this we will utilize the <code>renderPlot()</code> and <code>renderValueBox()</code> functions of the <code>flexdashboard</code> package, as well as the <code>selectInput()</code> function from the <code>shiny</code> package. See this <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/shiny.html">website</a> for more information on using <code>shiny</code> to create interactive dashboards with <code>flexdashboard</code>.</p>
<hr />
<details>
<summary>
Click here to see the code for this page.
</summary>
<p>The first thing we need to do to allow this page to be interactive is to add <code>runtime: shiny</code> to the YAML header at the top of the R Markdown file.</p>
<p>The next thing we want to do is add the <code>{.sidebar}</code> attribute to the first column of this page. This allows us to use <code>shiny</code> input functions in this column.</p>
<p>Then, we use the <code>selectInput()</code> function to create a menu for the user to interact with and add it to this column.</p>
<p>Finally, we use the <code>renderPlot()</code> function and <code>renderValueBox()</code> function to use the input from the user to render plots and value boxes based on their input.</p>
<p>The <code>selectInput()</code> function allows us to provide the user with a pull down menu of options for states. The main arguments for this function are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>inputId</code> - this is what the selection will be called in subsequent code</li>
<li><code>label</code> - this is what the user sees above the pull down menu</li>
<li><code>choices</code> - this is a list of options for the menu</li>
<li><code>selected</code> - this causes a particular option to be the default choice</li>
</ol>
<p>This is placed in a column on the far left side that is more narrow than the others.</p>
<pre><code>State Statistics {data-icon=fa-flag-checkered}
===================================== 

Column {.sidebar data-width=250}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the statistics shown do not account for other possibly influential state specific features like population density or gun laws among others.


&#39;&#39;&#39;{r}
  
selectInput(inputId = &quot;state_selected&quot;, 
            label = &quot;Select a state to explore:&quot;,
            choices = shooting_data %&gt;% 
            pull(State) %&gt;% 
            unique() %&gt;%
            sort(), selected = &quot;Alabama&quot;)

#  Washington, D.C. gets excluded by this
&#39;&#39;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Note that we used the <code>unique()</code> function to select only unique values of the <code>State</code> variable of the <code>shooting_data</code> tibble. The <code>sort()</code> function was used to put the options in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>In the next column, we have our plots like we did on the last page. Again we will use <code>tabset</code>. However, the difference here is that we need to include the <code>renderPlot()</code> function around all of our code for each plot and we need to use the data that the user selected.</p>
<p>This will automatically be in a data object called <code>input</code> and it will be within a variable called <code>state_selected"</code> based on what we used for the <code>inputID</code> in the <code>select_Input()</code> function (this requires the base R way of selecting a specific variable using the <code>$</code>).</p>
<p>Notice that the <code>renderPlot()</code> function requires that the code be within brackets <code>{}</code>. The data is filtered first for just the state that was selected. The code for the plots is essentially the same with minor modifications to allow for all unique cases that the different states present. For example the <code>deaths_perc_event %&lt;&gt;%filter (!duplicated(category))</code> is added to the last plot about the number of deaths per school shooting to avoid duplication of the rows in cases like Colorado where the there is only one event that had 4 or more deaths (because in the other cases this value is a sum of all school shooting with 4 or more deaths).</p>
<p>It’s always good to check as many possible input values as possible to make sure that your plot shows up as you expect!</p>

<h2><strong>The Map page (Interactive)</strong></h2>
<hr />
<p>Next, we create our map page. Previously, in the <a href="#section-data-exploration-and-wrangling"><strong>Data Exploration and Wrangling</strong></a> section, we geocoded our data and modified the <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> variables so that events that occurred in the same location would have slightly different values so that they will not cover one another in our map.</p>
<p>To create our map, we will use the <code>leaflet</code> package which uses the <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> JavaScript library.</p>
<div id="section-leaflet" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Leaflet</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p><code>Leaflet</code> works by provided by adding base data (such as a map) and then adding markers if desired in layers. This is very similar to how <code>ggplot2</code> functions (pun intended).</p>
<p>The layers displayed can be controlled using a sort of legend. Depending on the type of layers, some information may be displayed mutually exclusive of the other layers; other layers (such as circles/general markers) can be toggled on and off.</p>
<p>Clustering options can also be applied to circles/markers. Some examples of this can be found on the bottom of <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/markers.html">this website</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>groups</code> in leaflet can be thought of as layer-specific IDs that create labels for legends and allow specific layers to be referred to in separate functions.</p>
<p>Thus, if we called a group “Layer 1” and then in a subsequent layer refer to “Layer 1”, <code>leaflet</code> will correctly identify which layer is being referenced.</p>
<p>Note that <code>leaflet</code> can require a lot of computational power depending on the types of maps produced.</p>

<p>First, we create a smaller dataset that just includes the data that we want to use in the map. We will include the date, the name of the school and the narrative for each point as a <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/popups.html">popup</a> that will be shown when the user hovers over a point.</p>
<p>We need to do this using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> code as the <code>leaflet</code> package will ultimately render the map using this language.</p>
<p>We use the <code>paste()</code> function to combine these elements as well as HTML code to create line breaks and bold the name of the school.</p>
<p>To create line breaks in HTML, the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> syntax is used. This is used to separate each part of the elements that are getting pasted together with the base <code>paste()</code> function by being specified as the separator with the <code>sep</code> argument.</p>
<p>To create bold font in HTML, the text is surrounded by <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/b&gt;</code> like so: <code>&lt;b&gt; Bold text &lt;/b&gt;</code>. Thus only the school name is in bold.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> are content dividers in HTML. They separate the individual school shooting event information sections that will be plotted on the map. The first divider can also take information about the style of the output. This uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> code, which is what is used to stylize HTML.</p>
<p>The code here states that the height of the text box for each event should have a height that is proportional to the text, that the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height">height of each line</a> should be of 1 <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units.en.html">em units</a> (em stands for element). Hence, 1 unit relative to the size of the element. Therefore gaps between lines are the same height as the lines of text. The <code>overflow:visible</code> code specifies what to do in case the text box text is too large - in this case users can scroll (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow">here</a> for more options), and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding">padding</a> specification sets the size of the margins of the text box around the text.</p>
<p>See this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">website</a> to learn more about HTML code.</p>

                              sep = &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)


&#39;&#39;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The next bit of code then uses this data and the <code>shooting_data_geocded</code> to actually create the map!</p>
<p>The <code>leaflet()</code> function from the <code>leaflet</code> package creates a Leaflet map <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget">widget</a> using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/htmlwidgets/index.html"><code>htmlwidgets</code></a> package, which allows the map to be rendered as an application within HTML websites.</p>
<p>This first line of code starts the process of making the widget, but just like the <code>ggplot()</code> function from <code>ggplot2</code> it creates an empty map and layers need to be added.</p>
<p>The <code>addProviderTiles()</code> function from the <code>leaflet()</code> package does just that, by adding the map background. We will add three different kinds of map backgrounds. See <a href="http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html">here</a> for all the options of providers which create a variety of distinct backgrounds and then the <code>group</code> argument names each of these layers to be referred to later. The last layer added will be the one shown by default.</p>
<p>At this point we still only have a map in general. Now we need to add the data about school shooting events.</p>
<p>To do this, we add markers to the plot using the <code>addCircleMarkers()</code> function. This function takes many different arguments. See details about them <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/leaflet.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Importantly, we need to specify what variables in our provided data <code>shooting_data_geocoded</code> contains the longitude values (<code>lng</code>) and the latitude values (<code>lat</code>).</p>
<p>We will also use the following arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>radius</code> - argument specifies how large the circles for the points will be<br />
</li>
<li><code>color</code> - argument specifies the color of the individual points<br />
</li>
<li><code>fillOpacity</code> - argument allows for the filling of the points to a bit translucent if set below 1<br />
</li>
<li><code>clusterOptions</code> - argument can be used to cluster points together into larger circles<br />
</li>
<li><code>group</code> - argument specifies what the points should be called in the legend and what this layer should be referred to as for later use</li>
</ul>
<p>We also add a mini map using the <code>addMiniMap()</code> function, which can be useful to see where you are on the map. The type of plot style to use for the mini map is specified with the <code>tiles</code> argument and the <code>toggleDisplay</code> argument allows for the user to remove this feature.</p>
<p>Importantly, the <code>addLayersControl()</code> function allows users to toggle between different backgrounds and markers. In our case we have three different background layers which are referred to as <code>baseGroups</code> and we have one <code>overlayGroups</code> which is our circle markers for school shooting events. The group names for these need to be identified to allow users to toggle between them.</p>
<p>The <code>set_view()</code> function allows for the starting position and zoom to be modified. This allows us to center the map around the continental US.</p>

<pre><code>Tutorial {.storyboard data-icon=&quot;fa-list-ol&quot;}
=========================================   

### **1)** Load the `flexdashboard` package.

Install the package (and other supporting optional packages) if you don&#39;t have them installed already.

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(&quot;flexdashboard&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;shiny&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;leaflet&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)
&#39;&#39;&#39;

Once installed, load the package(s) into the `R` environment.

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r, echo=TRUE}
library(flexdashboard)
library(shiny)
library(leaflet)
library(ggplot2)
&#39;&#39;&#39;

This all needs to be done separately in the `R` console.

### **2)** Create an `RMD` document.   

Dashboards can be created with `flexdashboard` in the `HTML` format. 

The`flexdashboard` package uses `RMarkdown` to produce dashboards that can contain `R` output.

This makes it possible to include several mediums in dashboards such as plots created with `ggplot2` or maps created with `leaflet`.
    
### **3)** Create an appropriate `YAML`.

The use of `flexdashboard` alters the way R Markdown documents function. 

R Markdown documents can be rendered into many different outputs, one of which is a dashboard. 
The `YAML` header sets up how the document output should be created.

Here is an example of a `YAML` header that creates an `HTML` document from an R Markdown document:


---
title: &quot;Untitled&quot;
author: &quot;John Smith&quot;
date: &quot;8/12/2020&quot;
output: html_document
---


We used the following `YAML` for this dashboard, which importantly includes `flexdahsboard::flex_dashboard`which specifies that a dashboard should be created and `runtime:shiny` which allows for the dashboard to be interactive:

output: 
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    logo: https://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/icons8/windows-8/48/Programming-Dashboard-icon.png
    theme: readable
    orientation: columns
    source_code: embed
    vertical_layout: fill
runtime: shiny


We also introduced an icon as a logo, provided a theme with a color scheme, defined the orientation (and thus order) of coded output, added a navigation bar item to give users easy access to the code used, and  limited scrolling with the `verticle_layout: fill` option.

### **4)** Design the layout of the dashboard.

Dashboards are inherently visual, making this step the most time intensive after content creation. To goal is to present the data in a way that is both meaningful and visually appealing.

On this dashboard, we wanted to present static plots of the United States and of individual states. We also wanted to display the locations of school shootings and provide some information about school shootings. Aside from being a dashboard, we wanted to create an educational resource that was reproducible for others. Lastly, as this is a sensitive topic, we wanted to raise awareness and provide information that could help others act.

Given these goals, we decided on the following page layout:

+ About
+ The Data
+ US Statistics
+ State Statistics
+ Map
+ Tutorial
+ Get Help

The first page gives users to the opportunity to look at the data themselves. More complicated components such as the map of each incident were left alone on a single page. US and state-level statistics were separated from one another. This short tutorial on how to create the dashboard and source code were included in the dashboard with programmers at all levels in mind.

### **5)** Add content to the dashboard.

You can begin adding content to the dashboard once you have an initial layout in mind. Keep in mind that this will likely be an iterative process. 

The R Markdown file used to create a dashboard with `flexdashboard` works similarly as it does in other cases, with a few exceptions.

R code chunks can be defined like so:


&#39;&#39;&#39;{r, echo = TRUE}
# Code chunks can be explicitly included
&#39;&#39;&#39;

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r, echo = FALSE}

# Code chunks are hidden by default 
&#39;&#39;&#39;

Pages and columns within pages can be defined like so:


Page
=========================================   

Column {data-width=500}
-------------------------------------

Column {data-width=500}
-------------------------------------


### **6)** Add content to the pages and columns.

Plots and other elements can be added within columns like so:

### Plot name

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r}
# include plot code here
&#39;&#39;&#39;

Value Boxes, which are essentially text boxes, can be defined like so:


### ValueBoxText

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r}
valueBox(value = 10
  color = &quot;white&quot;)



Gauges, can be defined like so:

### GaugeText

&#39;&#39;&#39;{r}
flexdashboard::gauge(value = 10, 
                       min = 0, 
                       max = 100, 
                    symbol = &quot;%&quot;)

&#39;&#39;&#39;

####
Which will produce output like this:
&#39;&#39;&#39;{r, out.width= &quot;40%&quot;, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here(&quot;www&quot;, &quot;img&quot;, &quot;gauge_output.png&quot;))
&#39;&#39;&#39;

### Additional Info
As mentioned before, the `flexdashboard` metadata included in the `YAML` also alters how R Markdown documents are rendered.

<p>This page has two columns. The first column is much wider than the second. This first column includes two colored backgrounds which were created using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> code. See [The About Page] Details section to for more details about how this works.</p>
The text that we want altered with this particular style is delineated by the
<div>
to start and the
</div>
<p>to end the style.</p>
The instructions for the style are within the
<style> and </style>
<p>content dividers.</p>
<p>Inside these dividers is CSS code, which is what is used to stylize HTML. The div.blue is the name of the first particular style which involves a particular background color (#e6f0ffF) (see <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp">here</a> for more color options), with a boarder radius of 5 pixels to round the edges of the background color around the text with a size 5 pixel radius. The code also states that a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding">padding</a> specification for the size of the margins of the text box around the text and it specifies that font should be of 20 pixels.</p>
The div.blue specifies that blue is the name of this style, thus we can then use
<div class = blue>
<p>(called a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_Selector">CSS selector</a>) to style the text this way. This can then be used again any time we want this style like so:</p>

**Warning Signs**

From [Sandy Hook Promise](https://www.sandyhookpromise.org/gun-violence/know-the-signs-of-gun-violence/)...

&lt;style&gt;
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class = &quot;blue&quot;&gt;

Here is a list of potential warning signs that can signal an individual may be in crisis and/or need help:

+ Suddenly withdrawing from people and activities
+ Consistent bullying or intimidating others, or being bullied by others
+ Extreme mood or personality changes
+ Victim of constant social rejection
+ Talking about plans or actively making plans to harm themselves or others
+ Bringing a weapon to school – or threatening or talking about doing so
+ Bragging about or warning others about an upcoming act of violence
+ Recruiting others to join in a planned act of violence
+ Warning students to stay away from school or events
+ Expressing fascination with guns and/or school shootings
+ Expressing hopelessness about the future
+ Extreme, prolonged sadness or distress
+ Expressing or showing feelings of isolation
+ Bragging about access to guns

**This list is not a comprehensive list of warning signs nor does exhibiting one of these signs indicate imminent violence.**

According to the following article:

Flannery, D. J., Modzeleski, W. &amp; Kretschmar, J. M. Violence and School Shootings. Curr Psychiatry Rep 15, 331 (2013). DOI: [10.1007/s11920-012-0331-6](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-012-0331-6)

&quot;To date, studies of school shootings have concluded that no
consistent and reliable profile of school shooters exist, and
most researchers and clinicians would agree that predicting
violent behavior is a slippery slope that will usually result in
more false positives than false negatives.&quot;

&quot;...most shooters were depressed, had experienced some significant
loss, felt persecuted or bullied by others, and had prior
difficulty coping or had previously tried suicide. Most of
the shooters did not, however, have a history of drug abuse
or violence or cruelty to animals, common psychiatric indicators of risk, nor did they report excessive exposure to
violence in the media (though many produced their own
violent themes in writings or drawings).&quot;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.red { background-color:#BC8F8F; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class = &quot;red&quot;&gt;

According to the [National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/teen-depression/index.shtml){target=&quot;_blank&quot;}:

For youths who may be at risk for suicidal behavior, visit the **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL)** website at [www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org](www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org){target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

Additionally, the **Crisis Text Line** is another free, confidential resource available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Visit [www.crisistextline.org](www.crisistextline.org){target=&quot;_blank&quot;} for more information.

Also see [here](https://www.mhanational.org/depression-teens-0){target=&quot;_blank&quot;} for more information about how to recognize and help youths experiencing symptoms of depression and warning signs of suicide.

<h2><strong>Synopsis</strong></h2>
<hr />
<p>In this case study, we demonstrated the basics of R Markdown and how to create a dashboard with using the <code>flexdashboard</code> package. We also demonstrated how to include an interactive table with the <code>DT</code> package, how to include interactive plots using functions of the <code>shiny</code> package such as <code>renderPlot()</code>. We included interactive value boxes using the <code>renderValueBox()</code> function from the <code>flexdashboard</code> package, which works with the <code>shiny</code> package. Finally, we showed how to include interactive maps using the <code>leaflet</code> package.</p>
<p>This case study also explored how to properly calculate and interpret percentages when the data has missing values. We also discussed the benefits and limiting aspects of pie charts (using the <code>ggplot2</code> package) and waffle plots (using the <code>waffle</code> package).</p>
<p>Overall, the dashboard we created which can be found <a href="https://rsconnect.biostat.jhsph.edu/ocs-bp-school-shootings-dashboard/">here</a>, shows that the number of school shootings per year has increased overtime. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is simply due to increases in population alone or if the rate has increased due to other factors and if so, what those factors might be. It is also clear that the number of school shootings and the number of deaths per capita varies by state. There appears to be other aspects accounting for state differences.</p>
