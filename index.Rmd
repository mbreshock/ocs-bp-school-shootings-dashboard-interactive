## **Deaths per Shooting**
***

Next, we will make a plot of the number of deaths per school shooting based on the `Killed (includes shooter)` variable. 

#### {.recall_code_question_block}

<b><u> Question Opportunity </u></b>

See if you can come up with the code for the plot.

####

```{r dav_code1-setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)

load(here::here("www", "exercise", "dav_code1.rda"))
```

```{r dav_code1, exercise=TRUE}
deaths_per_event <-
  shooting_data %>%

per_shooting_plot <- deaths_per_event %>%


```

```{r dav_code1-hint-1}
deaths_per_event <-
  shooting_data %>%
  group_by(`Killed (includes shooter)`) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup()

per_shooting_plot <- deaths_per_event %>%

```

```{r dav_code1-hint-2}
deaths_per_event <-
  shooting_data %>%
  group_by(`Killed (includes shooter)`) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup()

per_shooting_plot <- deaths_per_event %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = `Killed (includes shooter)`, x = n)) +
    geom_col(fill = "black") +

```

```{r dav_code1-solution}
deaths_per_event <-
  shooting_data %>%
  group_by(`Killed (includes shooter)`) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup()

per_shooting_plot <- deaths_per_event %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = `Killed (includes shooter)`, x = n)) +
    geom_col(fill = "black") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Deaths per School Shooting",
         subtitle = "United States",
         x = "School Shootings",
         y = "")
```
